                <p>
                    Science education is the teaching and learning of science to school children, college students, or adults within the general public. The field of science education includes work in science content, science process (the scientific method), some social
                    science, and some teaching pedagogy. The standards for science education provide expectations for the development of understanding for students through the entire course of their K-12 education and beyond. The traditional subjects
                    included in the standards are physical, life, earth, space, and human sciences.

                    <p>Students who study general engineering take a wide range of courses in math, natural science, and humanities and social science. More specific engineering principles are taught in concentrations or minors tracks, which include biotechnology,
                        imaging, structural mechanics, environmental engineering, computer engineering, information science and nanotechnology. This major prepares students for many areas of the field with skills like analysis and problem-solving, teamwork
